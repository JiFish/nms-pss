# No Man's Sky Pokemon Storage System

**THIS SCRIPT IS AN EXPERMENTAL PROTOTYPE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. ALWAYS MAKE BACKUPS OF YOUR SAVES FIRST.**

No Man's Sky Pokemon Storage System is a python script that allows you to 'box' your No Man's Sky compainions to a file. Freeing up space now and allowing you to retrieve them later.

Python 3 is required.

Run `python pss.py` and follow instructions


## Future

This is a prototype. Step 2 is to refactor this script in to a library. Step 3 is to creature a Pokemon-inspired GUI for the software.
